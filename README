This is a simple twitch chat bot written in node.js

It will connect to https://www.twitch.tv/marbleracing and start playing. It will also open a local port on 3000 to allow for easy access to the channel chat.

This has been containerized based on the node:argon base image. Build it with:

docker build -t sgryczan/node-marbles
